This is my firsts exercises for algorithms class 

# Development notes
This algorithms are developed in pseudocode wih pseint software

# Problems to solve
1. Develop an algorithm that calculates the selling price of an item. There is a production cost of $40 and the calculation of the sale price is given by adding 120% as profit and 15% tax.
2. Develop an algorithm to find one of the sides of a rectangle whose area is 15 cm2 and one of its sides is 3 cm.
3. Develop an algorithm that allows calculating the average of a student who has taken 6 subjects
4. Find the area of a regular pentagon with a side of 6 cm and an apothem of 4 cm.
5. Find the area of a square whose side measures 5 cm.
6. Find the area and perimeter of a circle whose radius is 2 cm.

# Developer notes
